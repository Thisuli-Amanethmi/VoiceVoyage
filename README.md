# Indoor Home Navigation System for Visually Impaired People






## Overview
This project aims to develop an innovative indoor navigation system specifically designed for visually impaired individuals, enhancing their ability to navigate within their homes independently and safely. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies in object detection and landmark-based navigation, our system provides real-time guidance, helping users avoid obstacles and reach their desired destinations efficiently.
## Features
Object Detection: Utilizes advanced algorithms to identify and locate objects within the home environment, aiding in obstacle avoidance and path planning by using YOLOv8 algorithm.

Landmark-Based Navigation: Employs a structured description of home layouts to create navigational landmarks, facilitating easy and intuitive orientation and movement.

Custom Home Layout Input: Allows household members to input a detailed description of their home’s layout, ensuring personalized and accurate navigation assistance.

Dynamic Ontology Creation: Generates a comprehensive ontology from the home layout description, capturing the spatial relationships between objects for enhanced navigation.

User-Oriented Navigation Algorithm: Considers the user’s orientation and spatial relationships between objects to navigate the user safely.
